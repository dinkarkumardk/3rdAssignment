# 📋 Assignment Solution: Delivery Failure Analysis System

## 🎯 **Business Challenge Addressed**

Our system solves the core problem of **fragmented delivery failure analysis** by:

1. ✅ **Aggregating Multi-Domain Data** - Unified 7 siloed data sources
2. ✅ **Correlating Events Automatically** - Links weather, traffic, and operational factors
3. ✅ **Generating Human-Readable Insights** - Natural language explanations instead of dashboards
4. ✅ **Surfacing Actionable Recommendations** - Specific operational improvements

*High-level flow:* a natural language request enters through the CLI, entities/intents are extracted, relevant data is scoped, analytics/ML models run, and the narrative layer assembles the response before caching the results for fast reuse.

## 🧩 **System Components & Responsibilities**

1. **NLP Query Interface** – Captures raw natural language and routes it into the analyzer. Handles CLI/interactive inputs and validates empty/exit commands.
2. **Intent & Entity Processor** – Tokenizes queries, normalizes text, performs fuzzy entity extraction (cities, warehouses, clients, time periods) and classifies intent (analysis, comparison, prediction, optimization, causation, capacity).
3. **Data Access & Integration Layer** – Loads and refreshes the seven CSV datasets, performs schema normalization, joins them into the `master_data` frame, and computes derived metrics (durations, delays, issue flags).
4. **Analytics & ML Engine** – Runs rule-based analytics, aggregates KPIs, and (when enabled) executes ML pipelines: issue prediction, delivery time forecasting, satisfaction scoring, anomaly detection.
5. **Caching & Performance Layer** – Manages TTL and LRU caches for query contexts and heavy computations, tracks response time metrics, and powers parallel execution for batch demos/tests.
6. **Narrative & Visualization Generator** – Formats results into human-readable narratives, composes business recommendations, and (when visualization is enabled) produces charts/word clouds plus JSON reports for export.

Each component is implemented inside `CompleteNLPDeliveryAnalyzer` but encapsulated as dedicated methods to keep responsibilities isolated and maintainable.

## 🔄 **Request Lifecycle (Step by Step)**

1. **Query Intake** – User enters a question; the system logs it and performs cache lookup.
2. **Context Building** – Intent/entity processor extracts cities, warehouses, metrics, and time windows; confidence score is calculated.
3. **Data Scoping** – Data integration layer filters the unified dataset according to detected entities/timeframes and computes derived columns on demand.
    - *Analysis/Comparison*: Aggregates KPIs, compares segments, runs trend analysis.
    - *Prediction/Capacity*: Invokes ML engine for risk forecasts and what-if scenarios.
    - *Optimization/Causation*: Applies rule-based diagnostics, correlation checks, anomaly detection.
5. **Enhancement & Visualization** – Optional generation of charts, heatmaps, or word clouds; caching layer stores intermediate outcomes.
6. **Narrative Assembly** – Narrative generator crafts executive summaries, bullet recommendations, and structures the final Markdown/console output.
7. **Response Delivery** – Result returned to CLI; execution metrics recorded for monitoring. Exports (JSON/plots) are written to disk when requested.

## � **Example Walkthrough: Capacity Planning Query**

To help reviewers see exactly how the code paths work together, here is a full trace for the interactive question:

> **User question:** “If we onboard Client Y with ~20,000 extra monthly orders, what new failure risks should we expect and how do we mitigate them?”

### 1. Startup preparation (before any question)

- `__init__()` loads the seven CSVs (`load_all_data()`), joins them into `master_data` (`create_unified_dataset()`), discovers real patterns (`discover_dynamic_patterns()`), primes NLP dictionaries (`setup_advanced_nlp()`), and trains the ML models (`setup_machine_learning()`).
- Because all of that work is cached on the analyzer instance, the interactive query can respond in well under a second.

### 2. Query intake and context building

- `process_natural_language_query()` prints the “🤖 Processing …” line, checks caches, and calls `understand_query_context()`.
- `understand_query_context()` recognizes the **capacity planning** intent with confidence 1.00, thanks to keywords like “onboard” and “extra orders,” and extracts the entities (none beyond the client phrase).
- The method logs “🧠 Understanding: capacity_planning” and returns a `QueryContext` object.

### 3. Routing to the right handler

- `process_natural_language_query()` hands the query and context to `generate_intelligent_response()`.
- `generate_intelligent_response()` routes capacity-planning intents to `handle_capacity_planning_query()`.

### 4. Capacity planning analysis

- `handle_capacity_planning_query()` parses “~20,000 extra monthly orders” via regex, figures out the additional volume, and pulls current KPIs from `master_data`.
- It calculates projected volume, issue-rate uplift, capacity utilization, and writes the formatted sections (“Current vs. Projected Volume,” “Risk Assessment,” “Key Risk Areas,” etc.).
- Mitigation advice (infrastructure, operations, technology, timeline, success metrics) is generated inside the same method based on the computed strain level.

### 5. Machine-learning add-ons

- After the textual response is built, `process_natural_language_query()` calls `generate_ml_insights()` to enrich the answer.
- `generate_ml_insights()` filters data via `_filter_data_by_entities()` (in this case, the whole dataset because no city/time was supplied).
- It then:
    - Computes the contextual risk score using `_predict_issue_risk()` (classified as **High** with probability 0.816).
    - Summarizes top factors for each trained model via `_get_top_factors()` (dispatch delay, hour, picking duration, etc.).
    - Runs `_detect_anomalies()` to flag 10% anomalous timing records.
- The resulting JSON block is appended as the “🤖 ML Insights” section seen in the interactive output.

### 6. Final assembly and telemetry

- `process_natural_language_query()` captures elapsed time (0.48 s), prints the “⚡ Processing time” line, caches the finished response, and returns it to the CLI.
- Because the response includes both the narrative from `handle_capacity_planning_query()` and the ML extras, reviewers can trace each segment to the methods above.

### 7. Component-to-output mapping

| Output Snippet | Responsible Method(s) |
| --- | --- |
| “🤖 Processing … / 🧠 Understanding …” header | `process_natural_language_query()`, `understand_query_context()` |
| “📊 **Capacity Planning Analysis: Client Onboarding Impact**” block | `handle_capacity_planning_query()` |
| Mitigation strategy bullets | `handle_capacity_planning_query()` |
| ML insights JSON (risk, factors, anomalies) | `generate_ml_insights()`, `_predict_issue_risk()`, `_get_top_factors()`, `_detect_anomalies()` |
| “⚡ Processed in … seconds” footer | `process_natural_language_query()` |

This walkthrough can be reused for demo narration so reviewers clearly understand which method produced each portion of the interactive response.

## �🧪 **Tech Stack by Component**

| Component | Primary Technologies | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| NLP Query Interface | Python CLI, `input()` loop, logging | Interactive session in `interactive_session()` provides guided examples. |
| Intent & Entity Processor | `re`, `fuzzywuzzy`, `cachetools`, custom patterns | Fuzzy thresholds configurable via `config.json`; supports multilingual month names. |
| Data Access & Integration | `pandas`, `numpy`, datetime utils | Converts timestamps, computes derived KPIs, maintains master dataset. |
| Analytics & ML Engine | `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn` (RandomForest, GradientBoosting), `cachetools` | ML optional; gracefully degrades if sklearn unavailable. |
| Caching & Performance | `cachetools.TTLCache`, `cachetools.LRUCache`, `asyncio`, `ThreadPoolExecutor` | Reduces repeated computation; tracks response times. |
| Narrative & Visualization | Python string templating, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` (optional), `wordcloud` | Visualization toggled via constructor flags; reports exported as JSON. |

> **LLM Usage:** Not utilized in this implementation. All language understanding relies on deterministic NLP + classical ML. If an LLM layer is added later, prompts and guardrails will be documented alongside the integration.
